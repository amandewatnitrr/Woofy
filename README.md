## Problem Statement
<p align="justify">
Consider the possibility that we utilize this innovation to help moms. Also, that is the thing that precisely this framework will do. During the earliest stages of a child, the mother needs to deal with the child day and night without letting the child be anyplace. For working ladies, it prompts unsettling influence in their profession as they need to take long leave for caring for the youngsters and now and again it brings about leaving their place of employment. So to facilitate the chaotic existence of moms, this framework will screen the child when left alone. The possible time when moms can accomplish some other work is when the child is dozing. Yet, during this time mother can't go excessively far from the child, as the child may awaken and cry or the child may discharge and the waste can prompt any kind of diseases if not cleaned for quite a while. By dreading this load of results, a mother is never in danger of letting her child be.
